Quest : "Death comes from on high" - Requires you to hit spacebar for it to actually start moving at the right speed and start flying like it should. 
It should automatically kick into effect when it lands in the right spot, you should need to hit the space bar. 

When using the Gryphon to go down to Death's Breach from Acherus (LEFT - LOOKING OUT) flies straight through the bar.

[WAYPOINT-DK INITIATE]These mobs should be running around coming from the flying mounts, running to prince valanar then running to areas like the 3rd screenshot i sent you.
